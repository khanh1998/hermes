# Authentication process
1. `Client` send username and password to `Auth` to get a jwt. Now it can access to resource in `API` using that jwt.
2. `Client` send a request to `Auth` to get another jwt token to authenticate with `Socket`. In this request, the jwt in step 1 will be put in the header. So only authenticated user can send this request.
3. `Client` send a request to `Socket` to make a socket connection between client and socket server, using token acquired in step 2.
